[Git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) - create branch in separate folder  
[Git bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) - search for first bad commit

## Motivation
Bisecting may take a while and it makes repository "taken" so no work can be done in it until `bisect` finished.

## Create new worktree
```sh
git worktree add -b branch-name <path>
cd <path>
```

## Define "good" and "bad" revisions
```sh
git checkout <good-revision>
# run check to make sure it reports **PASS**
```

```sh
git checkout <bad-revision>
# run check to make sure it reports **FAIL**
```

## Bisect
```sh
git bisect start
git bisect good <good-revision>
git bisect bad <bad-revision>
git bisect run <check script>
git bisect reset
```

## Clean up worktree
```sh
rm -rf <path>
git worktree prune    # cleans up `.git/worktrees
```

## Summary
Using `bisect` alone is the fastest way to find *buggy* commit. Adding `worktree` to this workflow helps with time saving: you can continue your work while `bisect` is looking for bugs for you. No more *I should wait* or N+ cloned repos.
